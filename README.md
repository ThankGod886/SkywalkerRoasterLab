# SkywalkerRoasterLab
This is a program I modified to allow Skywalker Roaster to connect to Artisan and HiBean.
Using ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 as the controller and Artisan BLE BRIDGE.

Develop a Modbus device using an Arduino Uno or Nano and a MAX6675 (KType) or MAX31865 (RTD). Connect it to a computer via USB to add a second temperature probe to the Skywalker. In Artisan, simply add an extra device to use it. The original ESP32 S3 controller can run simultaneously without any changes.
